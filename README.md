An Open Source WordPress theme for Easy Digital Downloads

## Description

This theme will allow you to utilize the Easy Digital Downloads plugin to sell digital goods on your WordPress website, in style.

## Live Demo &amp; Release Notes

*Please note:* Live demo is currently down while making a server move.

Looking for more details behind the theme that aren't included in this readme doc? I've done a [write up](http://www.robertdevore.com/peddle-free-wordpress-theme-for-easy-digital-downloads) that gives a more thorough breakdown of the theme, it's built in options, and the road ahead.

## Slackedd

On 2.1.16 I released the WordPress plugin, Slackedd. This plugin lets you receive payment notifications from Easy Digital Downloads in your Slack channel of choice. Slackedd also has built in plugin update notifications for your WordPress dashboard so you'll never miss an update.
